# Graded Project - Mahanoro Station

![Design preview for the Mahanoro station coding challenge](./design/1.png)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this app and get it working with **redux**, **compound components** and **styled components**, while making it look as close to the design as possible.

This is a website that will allow us to reserve some seats in _"Taxi brousses"_ departing from Mahanoro station.

Your users should be able to:

- Pick a city from the city list
- See the available trips to that city, and pick one where seats are still availalable
- Select one or more seats in the car, and see how much it's going to cost
- Confirm the booking
- See their confirmed bookings on the 'My account'page
- Modify their own information, like name or phone number, on that same page.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs from this Figma link: https://www.figma.com/file/6gSAJpaedebKAUuaM4ekFR/Mahanoro-Station?node-id=4%3A38

The data from the trips are available on this link : https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Pinois/36bb5fbf9b6a686f0baf4006dd137bca/raw/a40d8b3f696a75f388db286d57bdd05a925fa0e7/trips.json

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). This will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need some help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a URL. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, but I recommend you to use **Netlify**.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead how your data and reducers will look like.

## Submit your project

You have until **Tuesday** at **15h30** to submit your github link and netlify link on this form : https://forms.gle/ikBWC2MokmdH4jdw6

**Have fun building!** 🚀
## Report of My work 
1 I use a Redux  to finish this project.  In this project , I put all of my code in the src which a folder contains : component  actions , reducers , image , styles. 
I put all of the action inside of the cation.

I have fetched the API inside of the reducer and action and then I connect it in the App file. The reason why I put this connection inside of the App is because I have to fetch it once.

After that , I destruct the state and then  I pass it in each element so that I can access this Api everywhere.

## Trick
I have got some problems with this project , I could not manage to finish the Update on the MyAccount.
I can add when I confirm my place but I could not manage to multiply the price and I could not get the number of seats . Not only that but I don’t have enough time to work out of the cancel button
